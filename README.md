# Wise + Team Discover @ JunctionXBudapest 2021


Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This the main repo for Team Discover's submisson of the Wise challenge. To keep things simple, it was written in React Native using the Viro AR framework.


**Is the AR really working?**

Yes! Find us during the judging period around the venue and you can try it out yourself.




**Can I run this at home?**

Of course. The Viro Team offers extensive [guidelines](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/develop-with-viro) on how to run AR applications in a local environment.
You can clone this repo and give it a try in no time.
